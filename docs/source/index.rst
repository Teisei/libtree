Welcome to libtree's documentation!
===================================

`libtree` is a Python library which assists you dealing with large, hierarchical data sets. Its main features are:

* handles billions of nodes
* fast reads and fast writes
* attribute inheritance (see :ref:`properties`)
* no transaction requirements
* memory efficient (iterators available everywhere)

To use `libtree`, you need to have a running Postgres 9.4 server and either Python 2.7, 3.4 or PyPy3.
