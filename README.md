libtree
=======

libtree is a Python library which assists you dealing with large, hierarchical
data sets. Its main features are:

  - handles billions of nodes
  - fast reads and fast writes
  - attribute inheritance (called "properties")
  - no transaction requirements
  - memory efficient (iterators available everywhere)

To use libtree, you need to have a running Postgres 9.4 server and either
Python 2.7, 3.4 or PyPy3.

Please refer to the docs for more information.
